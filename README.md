# Saskatchewan_Icequake_Processing
Alpine glacier seismicity analysis codes custom-developed for the dense nodal array deployment at Saskatchewan Glacier, Canadian Rocky Mountains

version_1/ contains archived processing scripts from analyses in 2019/2020 used to develop the basal ice-quake catalog presented in a number of talks by 
N.T. Stevens and others from the AUG 2019 nodal seismic deployment on Saskatchewan Glacier and the dissertation by N.T. Stevens.

Waveform and initial catalog data are archived at: https://minds.wisconsin.edu/handle/1793/83756 (and links to the IRIS-DMC therein).
