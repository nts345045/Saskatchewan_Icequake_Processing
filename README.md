# Saskatchewan_Icequake_Processing
Alpine glacier seismicity analysis codes custom-developed for the dense nodal array deployment at Saskatchewan Glacier, Canadian Rocky Mountains

EPSL_Accepted_Codebase/ contains archived processing scripts from analyses in 2019/2020 used to develop the basal ice-quake catalog presented in a number of talks by N.T. Stevens and others from the AUG 2019 nodal seismic deployment on Saskatchewan Glacier and the dissertation by N.T. Stevens.

version_2/ contains processing scripts that expand upon version_1/ including a parallelized implementation of the F-statistic dynamic threshold from Carmichael et al. (2013, 2015) and updated use of parallelization libraries.

These codes heavily leverage SQLite database interfaces and schema provided by the PISCES project (https://github.com/LANL-Seismoacoustics/pisces) from its earliet release on GitHub. In future versions (version_3 | new MAIN branch) these dependencies may be relaxed in favor of use of Pandas for relational
table management to mitigate obsolescence and use of more-popular tabular data interfaces.

Waveform and initial catalog data are archived at: https://minds.wisconsin.edu/handle/1793/83756 (and links to the IRIS-DMC therein).
